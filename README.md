This application is freely expired by http://www.noop.nl/2012/11/the-kudo-box.html.
Kudo Box is an app to implement the kudo reward system within an organization.

Our idea is to lean meteor with a real application example.





Run the Application

This application is developed using Meteor 6.4.1 and some extra packages managed on atmosphere, so that it requires
meteorite (follow the installation procedure here: https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite).

Run command:
